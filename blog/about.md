I am a **software engineer** secretly aspiring to become a computer
scientist. My brain is usually occupied with thoughts related to
programming languages, security and
**[strange loops][strange-loops]**. As someone who gets paid to modify
text, I also happen to spend a lot of time poking around my text
editor. My weapon of choice is **[emacs][emacs]**.

Currently, I am working with an amazing team at **[Penneo][penneo]**
and developing services to simplify the process of **document
signing** using **digital signatures**. I think it's purty kool!

In the past, I was responsible for product development related to
Vulnerability Intelligence at **[Secunia][secunia]** (now Flexera
Software). I also spent some time working at Telenor .. an
organization way too big for my taste.

I am an introvert .. but if you are reading this, chances are that you
are too.. so get in touch. I prefer [email][email].
